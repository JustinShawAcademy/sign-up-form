## Programming Fundamentals Learned

### Core HTML Structure Concepts

*   **Semantic HTML Forms:** Understanding proper form structure and accessibility.
    *   **Form Elements:** Using `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, and proper form attributes (`action`, `method`).
    *   **Input Types:** Implementing different input types (`text`, `email`, `password`, `number`) for data validation.
    *   **Label Association:** Connecting labels to inputs with `for` and `id` attributes for accessibility.
    *   **Form Organization:** Using fieldsets to group related form controls logically.

*   **Document Structure & Layout:**
    *   **Two-Panel Design:** Creating distinct left and right panel sections for visual hierarchy.
    *   **Container Organization:** Using wrapper divs like `.form-container` and `.form-group` for styling control.
    *   **Button Placement:** Strategic positioning of call-to-action elements outside form containers.

### Advanced CSS Layout & Styling

*   **Modern Form Styling Techniques:**
    *   **Input State Management:** Creating focus states with `:focus` pseudo-classes for better UX.
    *   **Transition Effects:** Using `transition: border-color 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease` for smooth interactions.
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Implementing hover and active states for buttons with transform effects.
    *   **Typography Hierarchy:** Using `text-transform: uppercase` and modern font stacks for professional appearance.

*   **Advanced Visual Design:**
    *   **Box Shadows:** Adding depth with `box-shadow` for form containers and focus states.
    *   **Border Radius:** Creating modern, rounded corners for inputs and buttons.
    *   **Color Systems:** Organizing consistent color schemes across form elements and states.
    *   **Responsive Units:** Using `vh` (viewport height) and `rem` units for scalable layouts.
